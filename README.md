Your code is clean and correct for using an LSTM to predict stock prices from the `Close` column in a CSV file. ✅

To **avoid any confusion or errors**, here are a few final checks and tips to ensure it runs smoothly:

---

### ✅ **File Check**

Make sure `stock_data.csv` is in the **same folder** as your Python script or Jupyter Notebook.

If you're using **Google Colab**, upload the file first:

```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
```

Then change the line:

```python
data = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')
```

To:

```python
import io
data = pd.read_csv(io.BytesIO(uploaded['stock_data.csv']))
```

---

### ✅ **CSV Format Check**

Your CSV must contain at least these columns:

```
Date, Close
```

Here's a sample of how the data should look:

| Date       | Close  |
| ---------- | ------ |
| 2023-01-01 | 110.25 |
| 2023-01-02 | 111.40 |
| 2023-01-03 | 109.85 |
| ...        | ...    |

---

### ✅ **Optional Enhancements**

Would you like to:

* Include additional technical indicators like **Moving Averages**, **RSI**, or **MACD**?
* Use **all 100 features** from the dataset instead of just `Close`?
* Add a **web dashboard** (e.g., Streamlit) for interactive use?

Let me know which direction you'd like to take next!
