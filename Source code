Hereâ€™s a clear explanation of **each package** used in your AI-driven stock price prediction project:

---

### ðŸ“¦ **1. `numpy`**

```python
import numpy as np
```

* **What it does:** Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions.
* **Used for:** Handling numeric data (e.g., preparing time series arrays).

---

### ðŸ“¦ **2. `pandas`**

```python
import pandas as pd
```

* **What it does:** Powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
* **Used for:** Reading CSV files, handling date/time formats, indexing, and cleaning stock data.

---

### ðŸ“¦ **3. `matplotlib.pyplot`**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

* **What it does:** Basic plotting library in Python.
* **Used for:** Visualizing the predicted vs. actual stock prices.

---

### ðŸ“¦ **4. `sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
```

* **What it does:** Scales data to a specified range (commonly 0 to 1).
* **Used for:** Normalizing stock prices before feeding them to the neural network (LSTM).

---

### ðŸ“¦ **5. `sklearn.metrics`**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error
```

* **What it does:** Provides tools to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Used for:** Calculating RMSE and MAE to measure prediction accuracy.

---

### ðŸ“¦ **6. `math`**

```python
import math
```

* **What it does:** Provides access to mathematical functions.
* **Used for:** Calculating square roots (e.g., RMSE).

---

### ðŸ“¦ **7. `keras.models.Sequential`**

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
```

* **What it does:** Lets you build a linear stack of layers for neural networks.
* **Used for:** Creating the LSTM model for stock prediction.

---

### ðŸ“¦ **8. `keras.layers.LSTM`, `Dense`**

```python
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
```

* **LSTM:** A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) good for time-series data like stock prices.
* **Dense:** A fully connected neural network layer.
* **Used for:** Building the layers of your deep learning model.
